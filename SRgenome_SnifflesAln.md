# LR Alignment with calling SVs with Sniffles

We're following the [Sedlazeck et al 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990442/) paper to map long reads and call structural variants. 

This method was specifically developed to call SVs from long read data using 1) NGMLR as a long read aligner, and 2) Sniffles to call structural variants. 


## Nested inversions

Sniffles is one of the only programs to detect nested inversions.
