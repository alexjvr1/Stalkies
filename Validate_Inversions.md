# Validation of inversions

Use this approach to identify and characterise inversion and SVs [Beyter et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00865-4)

GraphTyper for pan-genome approach to calling SVs [GraphTyper2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13341-9)


1. Filter in Sniffles

2. Samplot of inversions

3. IGV manual inspection

4. Do the SR PacBio contigs map across the inversions? 

5. Do diagnostic primers map in a sensible place? And are the the correct length? 

6. Short reads
