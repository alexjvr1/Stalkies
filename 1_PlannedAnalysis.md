# Stalkie questions and analyses



## 1) What are the inversions associated with sex drive in SEFs? 


Analyses: 

Sniffles pipeline

Machine learning approach? 


## 2) Are inversions promoted by CNVs? 

Map CNVs and annotate. 

What are their functions? 


## 3) What is the functional implication of these inversions? 

- What genes are in the inversions? 

- Are some gene functions disrupted? 

Analysis: 

Annotate genome. Find genes associated with regions. Functional analysis


## 4) Can we date the inversions? Did they all arise at the same time? 


Analysis: 

Fst between inversions (See Ruff paper) 


## 5) Is there natural variation in the inversion pattern?

a) Is there is core set of inversions that are important? 

b) Are these the older inversions? 


Analysis: PanGenome with short reads?
