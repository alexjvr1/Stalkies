# Figures: Align contigs to chromosomes

We're using [Alvis](https://alvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/diagrams.html) to visualise the alignment of the contigs in the SR genome across the putative break points. 

I've mapped our SR genome against Wilkinson's ST genome and found some possible inversions:

We need to check if the breakpoints fall within contigs. I've identified the names of the contigs mapped across the breakpoints:

BP3: 

BP4: 

BP5:

BP6:

BP7:
